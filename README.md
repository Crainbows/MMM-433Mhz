# MMM-433Mhz

This is a module for the [MagicMirrorÂ²](https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror/).

Trigger Magic Mirror functions with 433Mhz signals such as garage remote keys or wireless PIR sensors.

## Dependencies

* [WiringPi](http://wiringpi.com/download-and-install/)
* [rpi-433](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rpi-433) (npm)
* [MMM-Remote-Control](https://github.com/Jopyth/MMM-Remote-Control) *optional - see actions configuration for details*

## Installation 

Clone this repository in to the `~/MagicMirror/modules/` directory.

```bash
cd ~/MagicMirror/modules
git clone https://github.com/crainbows/MMM-433Mhz
```
Install the node dependencies.
```bash
cd MMM-433Mhz
npm install
```
Once set up you can identify the code emmitted from your device by connecting your receiver to wiring pin 2 and using the following:

`node ~/MagicMirror/modules/MMM-433Mhz/scanner.js`

This will give you an output similar to below when your device is triggered.
```
Scanning for 433Mhz codes...
Code received: 4781610
```

## Using the module

To use this module, add the following configuration block to the modules array in the `config/config.js` file:
```js
var config = {
    modules: [
        {
            module: 'MMM-433Mhz',
            config: {
                wiringPin: 2,
                responses: [
                    {code: 4781610, action: "MONITOR", timeout: 300, soft: true}
                ],
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

## Configuration options

| Option           | Description
|----------------- |-----------
| `wiringPin`      | *Required* The data GPIO pin of the Raspberry Pi. Numbered according to the WiringPi Library. [Pinout](https://pinout.xyz/pinout/wiringpi) (Integer)
| `responses`      | *Required* See below for details.


### Responses

| Option           | Description
|----------------- |-----------
| `code`           | *Required* This is the unique code emitted by your 433Mhz device upon activation. (Integer)
| `action`         | *Required* The action to be performed.


### Actions

| Option           | Description                                       | Additional Options
|----------------- |-------------------------------------------------- |-----------
| `MONITOR`        | Switch the display on for a fixed period of time. | `timeout` *Required* (seconds) How long the display should be shown for before hiding again. .<br> `soft` *Required* (Boolean) Soft mode hides the body element and relys on the power saving mode of the monitor. When set to false Hard mode is selected where a notification is sent to MMM-Remote-Control to disable the display output.
| `SHUTDOWN`       | Sends a notification to MMM-Remote-Control to shutdown. | None
| `RESTART`        | Sends a notification to MMM-Remote-Control to RESTART. | None
| `REBOOT`         | Sends a notification to MMM-Remote-Control to REBOOT. | None
| `REFRESH`        | Sends a notification to MMM-Remote-Control to REFRESH. | None
